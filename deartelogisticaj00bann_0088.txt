ter of quantity or magnitude, rather than as number or multi-
tude 3 and calls them ‘⁶ nomina3’' because susceptible, he says,
rather of being named than numbered. Moreover3 he had con-
sidered these quantities so profoundly as to discover all their
computative properties, and fully to illustrate them under the

operation of all the rules of Arithmetic relative to discrete

number and quantity.

Having digested this important chapter of his system of
Logistic, Napier was struck with the necessity of a new nomi-
nation and notation wherewith to work, more easily and effec-
mally„ the peculiar quantities in question. The ancient geo-
metricians had derived their nomination of the successive
powers of a number„ entirely from the three local dimensions of
nature3—length, breadth, and thickness. Napier3 in his Com-
mentaries on the Revelation, took those co-existing qualities
as an illustration of the Trinity 3 but he was not satisfied with
their illustration of the geometrical progression of numbers.
A geometrical progression„ of which we hear so much in all
statements of the Logarithmic principle, is so called, because
the successive numerical powers which compose it were named
from the geometrica] extensions——represented by a line, a
surface or square, and a solid or cube. The square contains

two of the local dimensionsff—-length and breadth 3 in the cube
