theory of equations‚ whieh had received a great extension
from Tartalea and Cardan. The defeet which materially
impeded the system was in notation‚ the mainspring of muner-
ieal seienee. In the year 1544, Miehael Stifellius‚ a Lutheran
elergyman, published at. Nuremberg his Arithmetiea Integra,
a very original Latin treatise on Arithmetie and Algebra,
wherein he viewed numerieal quantities. and their combina-
tions„ closely and ingeniously, and gave an impulse to Algebra
hv improving its notation. He was the first to introduee the
signs -1- and —— for plus and minus„ and also the character „l
(derived from the letter R). to denote the radix or root.
Moreover, he entered systematieally into the consideration of
arithmetieal and geometrieal progressions, pointing out what
may now be termes] the logarithmio properties of a correspond-
ing· series of the powers of a given number, and the exponents
of those power& which latter term he uses. But in this spe-
eulation he had formed no conception of the possibility of
changing the infinite series of natural numbers from an arith-
metical to av geometrieal progression. and then of generating· a

eorresponding arithmetieal progression.

In the year 1552 appeared the first treatise upon Arith-
metie and Algebra in the English language. Its author was

the unfortunate Robert Reeorde. a mathematieian of un-
