treatise of Arithmeti03 but neither is it to be supposed that
116 would have written„ for instance„ the fifth chapter of his
second book of Arithmetic„ ‘⁴ De Multiplicationis et Parti-
tionis Compendiis Miscellaneis,” after having published the
Logarithms, without the slightest allusion to that means of
subststuting, for the real numbers„ a set of artificial numbers
rendering the whole art of calculation compendious beyond the

most sanguine hopes of emancipated Astronomy.

It is even more improbable that the treatises 111 question
were composed, or so far reduced to order, at some period in
the long interval which must have elapsed between the author's
conception of the Logarithms- and the construction of those
elaborate works by which the glory of the invention was
seem-ed to himself, and the benefit bestowed upon mankind.
In his book of Geonietrical Logistic„ N apier seems to allude
to the Arithmetic of Surds as a discovery of his own, the full
value of which he promises afterwards to disclose. Had he
been conseious at this time of the far more important secret of
the Loga1·ithms‚—which‚ after his first conception of the idea,
was his daily labour to the end of his days—there would, 111
all probability, have been some allusion to it. Indeed, his
great invention must have formed a most interesting chapter

of his work DE ARTE LofflsTmA, had he lived to complete it.
