1 INTRODUCTION.

Napier, in the first chapter of his Arithmetic, refers to
what 116 1611115 Geometrical Logistic, 35 forming the subject
of 1115 third book, and to Algebra, 35 being the subject of 3
fourth book. It would appear, however„ that his Algebra,
so far 35 “ orderlie sett doun‚” is 311 6311161 production than
either his Aritlnnetic or the fragment of Geoinetrical Logistic.
This is manifest fron] several circumstances :—l. It is entitled
*2 The Algebra of John Naper‚ Baron of Μ6161115101111;” but
not¹ Liber Quartus„ in correspondence with the other books.
2. Arithmetic 15 referred to in it ; but there 15 110 reference to
1115 own book 01Α1·11111116116, 35 there would have 116611, 3660111-
ing to his practice throughout the rest of the manuscript, 11311
that been previously composed. 3. The 11631156 of Algebra is
itself divided 11110 two books 3 31111, while there is a systematic
reference 10 115 component parts, 111616 15 110 reference 10 any
previous books. 4. Napier adopts in his Algebra the 1101111113-
tion 31111 1101311011 which had been introduced before his time 3
whereas, in his Aritlnnetic and Geometrical Logisffic„ he
adopts and expounds 3 peculiar 110111111311011 31111 1101311011 of
his own„ applicable to 1116 3111111116116 of Surds, and whereby
116 proposes to supersede that with which 116 operates in his
treatise of Algebra. There 6311 116 little doubt, therefore, that
his Algebra 15 3 work of still earlier date than 1116 other books;

and 111656, 35 1135 been 56611, were prior in date to his conception
