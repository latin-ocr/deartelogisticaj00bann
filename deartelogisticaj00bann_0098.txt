connected with the doctrine of Loga1²itlnnS‚ unnecessary to be
considered 11010, showing its natural affinity to the system of the
Arabic notation, which in fact only became perfectly developed
when the Logarithms were invented3 and it is singular that,
among the mathematical stores 'of those distant elimes from
which was derived the refined and powerful notation in question,
and throughout the long ages of its operation in the hands of
genius, not a trace can be discovered of a> conception of that
development of the scale which Napier accomplished in the
Logaritlnns and the arithmetic of Decimal fractions. The
Chinese are said 10 have laid claim to the invention; but the
splendid copy of the Logarithms which issued from the imperial
press of Pekin, contains certain errors which have been recently

discovered in the European 1311105, previously published.
