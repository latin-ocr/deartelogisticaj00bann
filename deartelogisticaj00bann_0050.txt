xxviii INTRODUCTION.

The third son of the Feudist was John Craig, afterwards
Dr John Craig‚ physician to James VI. 3 and he was also the
friend of John Napier, the son of 1115 father’s colleague in
office. But there was another„ and perhaps the stronger
tie. Young Craig was much given to mathematica] studies
There is one record, indeed, of his success in those pur-
suits, which of itself is sufficient to distinguish his memory
in that respect„—a record rarely met with in his own
country* and still seldomer perused. Ι allude to a small
volume of Latin epistlesa printed at Brunswick in the year
1737, and dedicated by their collector, ‘⁶ Rud. Aug. Nol-
tenius,’' to the Duke of Brunswick. The three first letters
in this collection are from Dr John Crawig to Tycho Brahe,
and they prove that he was upon the most friendly and con-
fidential footing with the Danish astronomer. He addresses
Tychoas his ‘⁴ honoured friendst' and signs himself} ‘⁶ your most
affectionate John Craig‚ Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine.''
The first of these letters (which are written in Latin) coni-
mences with the fact2 11131, “ About the beginning of last
winter that illustrious man, Sir William Stewart, delivered to
me your letter„ and the book which you sent me.” The date
of this letter is not given 3 but„ in the Library of the Univer-
sity of Edjnburgh, there is 3 mathematica] work by Tycho

Brahe„ which bears, upon the first blank leaf, 3 manuscript
