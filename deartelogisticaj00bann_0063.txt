mind must have been thoroughly and deeply imbued with
the Logistic art, and analytical power, ere he proposed to him-
self the invention of that great lever of science. Now it is in
the Latin treatises„ which these observations preface, that we
may trace Napier's command of Numbers, before he had
formed a conception of the Logarithms. And thus the pre-
sent work may be said to afl'ord a most interesting chapter in
the history of the progress of Science. A digest of the
whole art of Logistic. equal, in so far as the then existing
numerical notation admits of the comparisom to Euler's in
modern times‚ composed prior to the year 1594, amid the
storms of faction which then distracted Scotland, was an
achievement worthy of being crowned by the invention of
Logarithms, for the natural discovery of which, in the gradual
development of algebraic resources3 the analytic art was at the

Another circumstance may here be mentioned which also
affords evidence, that, many years prior to the publication of
the Loga1²itl1ms‚ Napier’s fame as a mathematician was esta-
blished with the learned of his own countrymen, and that he
was the person to whom Dr Craig would be most eager to
converse on the subject of his visit to Tycho Brahe. The
