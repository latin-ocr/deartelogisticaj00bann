eient to prove that his invention of the Logarithms was sub-
sequent to sueh speculations 3 for the mind which aeeomplished
the Logarithms, and eompounded that name for them, could
scarcely fail very soon to pereeive that the radieal signs, expres-
sive of a, surd root, were to be entirely superseded by fractional
exponents. Dr Hutton committed a strange anaehronism, and
one whieh does injustiee to the genius of Napier, in the follow-
ing passage :——⁶⁶ The notation of powers and roots, by the pre-
sent mode of exponentsq has introduced a new and general
aritlnnetie of exponents or powers3 for henee powers are
multiplied by only adding their exponents7 divided by subtract-
ing the exponentsq raised ‘to other powers, or roots of then]
extraeted. by niultiplying or dividing· the exponent by 1119
index of the power or root. So a‘2><a5:a5‚ and affixalzaQ
(15÷a³=a2q and [ιὲἑ-ς-(ιὲεαές the second power of (ιὸ is τιὸ, and
1119 third root of (ιῦ is αἳ. This algoritlnn of powers led
the way to the invention of Logarstlnns, which are only 1119
indices or exponentis of powers3 and hence 1119 addition and
subtraetion of Logarithms answer to the multiplication and
division of numbers„ while the raising of powers and the ex-
traeting of roots is effected by multiplying the logarithni by the
index of the power„ or dividing the logaritlnn by the index of
1119 root.”—Math. Diet. If the algorithm of whieh Dr Hutton

here speaks had belonged to seienee before Napier invented
