are the whole tinea—length, breadth, and thickness. In any·
progression of 1uunbers‚ increasing from unit by a common
ratio of multiplicatiom the second power contains two dimen-
sions of the root, and was called by the ancient geometricians
a square number7 01¹ square3 so the third power„ being com-
posed of three dimensions of the root, obtained the name of a
cubic number, or cube. But here the imperfect analogy became
exhausted3 for, while the powers of a number are infinite.
extension in space admits of no other distinctions than the
three above mentioned. Hence, by an expedient incongruens
in idea as well as unwieldy in practice, the hig-her powers were
designated as if repetitions of the geometrical dimensions.
This will be seen from the following table, which is given by
