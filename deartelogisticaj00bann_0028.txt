vi INTRODUCTION.

The transeripts are entirely in the handwriting of Robert
Napier himself, as is ascertained beyond doubt by a eomparison
with some of his letters in Lord Napier’s charter-ehest3 and
11115 title„ written on the first leaf, is also in his handwriting :—

⁴⁸ The Baron of Merehiston his booke of Arithmetioke
and Algebra. For Mr Henrie Briggs, Professor of Geometrie

at O xfordess’

That they were taken direetly from the author’s own
papers„ 15 proved by the note which the transcriber adds at the
conclusion of the fragment 011 Geometrioal Logistio :—

·· Ι could find 110 more of this Geometrioall pairt amongst

all 1115 fragments?

And also by another note which immediately follows the
abrupt termination of the Algebra :—

⁵⁴ There 15 110 more of 1115 Algebra orderlie sett doun.’'

These 110105, of which fae-similes will 110 found in their
respective places in this volume, seem to have been addressed
to Henry Briggs ς and they not only prove that the transcripte
were made from Napier's private manuseripts, but that Napier
himself had so far written out the treatises in the form now

published, and that more remained to be dig-ested and arranged.
