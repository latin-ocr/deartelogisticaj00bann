lxxiv INTRODUCTION.

that invention, that, having achieved the Logarsthms, he could
not fail immediately to perceive the application of fractional
indices for the expression of roots,-and7 consequently, that his
proposed notation of surdsa in his Geometrical LogistiQ was
comparatively crude and useless. This fact, which it would
occupy too much space fully to illustrate here, may be offered
as interna] evidence, afforded by the manuscripts now printed„
that they are studies which must have preceded the conception

of his great invention.

That which may truly be said to have led Napier to the
invention of Logarithms, is the profound view he took of
the Logistic of concrete quantity, after having thoroughly mas-
tered that of discrete quantity. The properties of what we
may now term the Logarithms of discrete ratios, namely.
the series of natural numbers taken to enumerate the steps or
terms of any geometrical progression represented by integ-ers,
had been known since the days of Archimedes. But the
desideratum was. to prove that the infinite series of natural
numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &Q might be viewed as in a geome-
trica] progression, and then to discover the indices of all these
numbers7 considered as powers of some given numbeig——which
would disclose the corresponding arithmetical series, and the

Logarithms par excellence. Less profoundly considered‚ the
