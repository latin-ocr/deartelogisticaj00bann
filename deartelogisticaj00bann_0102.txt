lxxx INTRODUCTION.

Binomial Theoren]7 in the case of integral and affirmative
powers7 which is of great use in the construction of Loga-
rithms.” But Napier had anticipated Pascal in this invention,
which, however, only received its most valuable algebraic
application, dependent as that is upon the modern exponent-ial

notation„ at the hands of Sir Isaac Newton.

There are other indications, in the manuscripts now sub-
mitted to the public„ of an inventive genius in Numbers, far
before the times in which Napier wrote. Professor Playfain
in his Dissertation on the Progress of hIatheniatical and
Physical Science‚ when speaking of Albert Girard,-a Fleniish
nmthematieian, whose principal work, Invention Nouvelle en
Algiabre, was printed in 1665-)‚——obse1¹ves7 ⁶⁶ He appears to
bave been the first who understood the use of negative roots in
the solution of geometrical probleins, and is the author of the
figurative expression which gives to negative quantities the name
of ⁶ quantities less than nothingss—fl phrase that has been severe-
ly censured by those who forget that there are correct ideas
which correct language can hardly be made to express. The
sanie mathematician conceived the notion of imaginary roots.
and showed that the number of the roots of an equation could
not exceed the exponent of the highest power of the unknown

quantity.’' Sir John Leslie. who continued Playfair's Disser-
