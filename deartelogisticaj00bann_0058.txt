had, which Stffellius, Byrgius, Longomontanus‚ and Kepler
himself had3 yet no more was made of it after the revival of
letters, than had been by Archimedes before their fall. Kepler
too, informs 115, that in the year 1594, something regarding
the generalization of this numerical principle had actually been
reported in a letter to Tycho; yet the secret was still undis-
covered until Napier publislied his Canon in 1614. In a
letter. dated 11111 11131911, 1618, to 1115 friend Schikharn
Kepler, after desc-fanting upon the various difficulties and
resources of trigonometry‚ exclaims‚—‘⁶ A Scotish Baron has
started up, his name Ι cannot remember‚ but he has put forth

and divisions is commnted 10 mere additions and subtractions,

difficulty of additions and subtractions, in some cases exceed the
labour of multiplication and division.‘” This was the first crude
and inaccurate idea formed by Kepler of the work which he had
1101 yet studied3 and already the Scotish Baron whose name
he could not remember was in his grave! But of this fact
Kepler was not aware even on the 28111 J uly, 1619, when he
