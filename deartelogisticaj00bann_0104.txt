surd uninome may be the root either of an abounding 01· of a
defective number, and that its index may be either even 01· odd.
from this fourfold cause it follows, that some surds are abound-
ing, some defective, some both abounding and defective, which I
term ⁴ gemina ς’ some neither abounding nor defective, which Ι

I have already laid in the sixth chapter of the first book ; and,
though hitherto unrevealed by any one else. so far as I know,

the velue of it to this art, and to Mathematics in general, shall

presently appear.qq

There ean be no doubt that by “ nugaeia⁷⁷ Napier means
the impossible quantity, and that he was the very first to eon-
eeive the idea, and to propose its use, in the arithmetie of
surds and the⁴theory of equations. He explains preeisely its
nature, and gives rules for its notation, and applies to it the
startling designations of ‘⁶ a quantity ahsm²d and impossible,
nonsensieal and signifying nothing.⁷⁷ He shows that all roots,
whether abounding or defeetive, (or, as he also ternis it,
greater or less than nothing) when multiplied to an even index
produce an abounding· radic-ate. Thus, take for the root
42, and let it be multiplied to the index 4, (in other words,

raised to the fourth power,) and the radieate will be -1-16 ; in
