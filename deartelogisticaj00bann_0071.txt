INTRODUCTION. xlix

accurate chronology of his treatises5 so far as can be aseer-
tained, would seem to be between the publications of Stevinus
of Germany, in 1582„ and those of Vieta of France, about the
commencement of the next century. Of all his predecessors
and contemporaries, however, Napier was the one destined to
create the greatest revolution in Numbers. This fact alone
must render the perusal of his early and preparatory labours
ver)v interesting to all who are capable of appreeiating his
great invention. Countries the most distinguished in Europe,
for men of seience‚ had produced in that recondite path the
few remarkable men so briefly and imperfectly noticed above.
But even the gigantic Kepler (on his own authority we state
it) had struggled in vain against the spell that yet bound the
Arabic system. From Archimedes to Kepler„ not one of the
victorious in the field of scienee had struck a blow sufficient
to extricate the best wing of mathematics. Until Napier
arose, the Arabio scale remained undeveloped. The name
of Recorde is barely sufficient to give England a place in the
previous history of the progress of science3 and as for Scot-
land, when Napier was acquiring for his country the fame of
one of the greatest impulses which human knowledge has
received„ it. was distinguished by mists which seience had not
penetrated, and by the Douglas wars, whose baronial leaders

knew little of the denary system beyond their mail-clad hands.
