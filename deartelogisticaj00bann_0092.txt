the relation of each to the original form, even when the
numerals are withdrawn. By this simple process there is
actually obtained an equivalent for the nine significant digits
of Arithmetic, suseeptible of the same oombinations, yet per-
feetly distinet in character. Napier’s unit of this system is
,1, and when the root whieh he wishes to represent is beyond
the original value of the highest of his digits9 which is Γ.
οονῖοεροηάᾶηὲς to 9, he obtains the tenth value by moving hjs
unit one step to the left3 indieating the move by placing a
eirole on the right of the significant digit, thus, —l⁰. In like
mannen his unit in its first place combined with the same
advaneed a step, thus --11, indicates the root of the llth
division„ or undeeupartient root, as he named it. Thus having·
invented a new set of dig-its equivalent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
9, he submitted them to the same law of progression as in

ordinary arithmetie.

Upon comparing the fragment of Geometrieal Logistie
with the first book of his Algebra, which Napier calls the

nominate part of Algebra‚ it will be obvious, that the latter had
