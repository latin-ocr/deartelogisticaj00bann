interesting not merely as the works of the Inventor of
Logarithms. but as being· the very first of the kind in seot-
land. and among the first systematie works on Numbers
after the revival of letters in Europe. The sixteenth een-
tury was the rudest period of algebraie seienee in Europe.
Leonardo of Pisa, indeed. composed his work before the inven-
tion of printing. and early in the thirteenth century 3 but this
had been lost sight of. and was not known for more than a
century after Napier’s death. when the manuscript was diseo-
vered at Florenee. The first printed work on the subject was
that of Lucas de Burgo. from whom is generally dated the
deeided dawn of Algebra in Europe. De Burgo’s prineipal
work was printed about the year 1494. The second printed
work upon Arithmetie and Algebra appeared in 1539. T his
was a work of the great but eeeentrie Cardan. of whom it is
affirmed by Scaliger that he was so devoted to astrology as
aetually to starve himself to death. that his own astrologieal
prediction might be fulfilled.-a very equivoeal illustration of
his favourite seienee. Cardan died in the year 1575. Germany
produced one or two mathematieians. who. at the same time
that Cardan wrote, gave a more deeided impulse to Numbers.
Hitherto nothing had been added to that recondite seience.
since the introduction of the Arabio numerals. and the rude

and imperfect symbols of Burgo’s Algebra. except in the
