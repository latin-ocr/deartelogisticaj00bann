Sir), a toil which is apt to deter most people from the study
of mathematicsq I have, all my life, with what powers and little
genius I possess, laboured to eradicate. And, with that end in
view, I published of late years the Canon of Logarithms (for
a long period elaborated by 1110), which, rejecting the natural
numbers. and the more difficult operations performed by them,
substitutes in their place others affording the same results by
means of easy additions„ subn-actions, and extractions of roots.
Of which Logarithms, indeed. I have now found out another
species much superior to the former, and intend, if God shall
grant me longer life. and the possession of 11031111, to make
known the method of constructing, as well as the manner of
using· them. But the actual computation of this new Canon, on

who are well versant in such studies3 and especially to that
