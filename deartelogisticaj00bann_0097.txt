idea that the arithmetical series, or progression by equi-
djfference of the natural numbers, could be viewed as a
geometrical series, 01· progression by multiplication, seemed
a contradiction in ternis. Napier commences by demon-
strating that the progressive increase, or decrease„ of a con-
crete or continuous quantity may be conceivcd to bc gener-
ated by a motion in space, so regulated, in respect of the
velocity. as to generate. a continuous geometrical progres-
sion³ of infinitely small ratios vof magnitude, various terms of
which might be represented, or infinitely nearly so, by the
series of natm·al numbers, which thus all become terms of
a geometrical progression. In like mannera he demonstrated
the genesis of a corresponding arithmetical progression by a
simultaneous motiom the velocity of which, being equal through-

of the corresponding point in the simultaneous geometrica}
motion. His idea of motion, thus taken to generate propor-
tional magnitudes, was analogous to the law of the Arabic-
notation in discrete numbers, where the significant digit may
be conceived to generate a decuple progressiom by travelling

in a line from right to left. There are various circumstances
