Logarithms and of the Rhabdologia.

It is very probable that Napier's progress‚ in composing
a complete digest of Numbers, might have been interruptech
and that work set aside for the time. in consequence of those
very operations having suggested his more profound inven-
tions ι but that he composed his Arithmetic and Algebra sub-
sequently to those inventions is most improbable, considering
that the dates of his published works are 1614 and 1617, and
that he died in the month of April of the latter year. More-
over. it appears that5 at the time of his death, Napier was
occupied in bringing to perfection his most elaborate and

after his death, when it was edited by his son Robert„ he had
left in a state for publication. This volume, with some pro-
found and original aids to the science of trigonometry added
as a supplement to it, must have occupied all the time which
he devoted to mathematics, (for he was still deeply engaged
with the Apocalypse.) between the date of the publication of

the Canon of Logarithms and the date of his death. The
