number„ but which he terms Radicatum⁷ is that which can be
reduced to unit. when dividcd one or more times by some other
number‚ the number of the partitions being· the index, and the
dividing number the radix. or root. Euler„ the great alge-
braic-al writer of the eighteenth century, had not a more pro-
fouud knowledge of the properties of the relative numerical
quantities, Root. Power„ and Exponent‚ than Napier in the
sixteenth century had of what he called Radix7 Radicatum.
and Index. Indeed. his opening of the subject of involution
is less perplexing than Euler’s, whose statement might leave
the student at a loss to know why the square of a number is
called the second power, and not the first. For Euler3 after
having said that a power of a number derives its rank„ or
particular denomination, from the number of times it is multi-
plied by itself, informs us, that a square is obtained by multi-
plying a number once by itselfi and a cube, by multiplying a
number twice by itself. Why, then, is a square called the
second power‚ since the elevation is obtained by the first mul-
tiplication of the number by itself? Napier avoids all such
perplexity, when he commences by saying, that the first step in
the process of involution is to ‘⁶ multiply unit by the radixq
which multiplication returns the radix itself 3 secondly. multiply
that again by the radix. and the duplicatum (the expressive

term he uses for square or second power) is produc-esst aud so
