merely that a surd root was talzem but what number of root it
was: and ‘this by symbols entirely new and unapprol›riated.
Since his dayq when roots were to be expressed by radical sign&
instead of by the number itself evolved, the expedient devised
was to retain the contracted R, as the initi-al of the word νοοῖ,
and to place within it a small numeral, as the index of the
quality of the root. Thus ss 10 expresses the cube root, ον, as
Napier would have called it, the tripartient. or third νοοῖ, ofthe
number ten considered as a radicatum or power. This nota-
tions—-which, it will be observed, gets rid of the unwieldy
expedient of repeating the initials -ἳ, fe, and st, for square,
cube, and supersolid, and presents to the eye the number of
evolutions requisite to obtain the particular root,-was not
invented until many years after Napier’s death. Now, the
notation to which he refers, in the sentence quoted above, was
so (levised as at once to express that a νοοῖ, of that number to
which it was attacheth was the quantity taken„ the particular
number or index of that νοοῖ, and the fact that the root was a

surd νοοῖ, ον concrete quantity. He took this simple combina-
tion of equal lines ssl: intersecting each other at equal

intervals. In the nine compartments, which this figure
presents2 he inserted the nine numerals,-for the sake, he

says. of assisting the memory. From the natural arrange-
