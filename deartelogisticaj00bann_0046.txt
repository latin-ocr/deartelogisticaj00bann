subsequent minor inventions5 arose out of the very attempt, to
abridge the toils of calculatiom which he indicates in the fifth
chapter of the second book of his Arithmetic, ‘⁶ De Multipli-
cationis et Partitionis Compendiis Miscellaneis.” In order to
ascertain, then, the age of his Arithmetic and Algebra„ we must
determine„ as nearly as possile the period of time when he

No one who has taken the trouble to examine Napier’s
original works‚ or who understands any thing of the nature
and construction of Logarithms‚ can doubt that many years of
labour must have elapsed, between the first idea of the system
in the inventor’s mind, and its publication⁷ in 1614, accom—
