lxxxiv INTRODUCTION.

But it appears, that, when Napier had broken ground
upon the great field of equations„ and with a vigom¹ and oom-
mand of the subject which obviously was about to anticipate
the oonquests of many of his illustrious suecessors, he was
arrested in that progress by another idea. The stars were
beooming too many for Tyeho and Kepler3 so he promised
them the Logarithms. His mind had already penetrated the
Arabio system in every direction. He had already orderly set
down how the various operations of number and quantity gra-
dually unfoch—how the vast fabric produces itself, growth after
growth. every rule the parent of anothen and the whole inti-
mately related, in all its parts, in endless generations of Num-
bers. Having traoed the genealogy of Numbers upwards from
nothing3 he had taken zero as the pivot for a reciproca] scale.
ancl unfolded the logistio of “ quantitates minores nihjlo‚” and
*⁸ quantitates impossibiles et nihil significantes?² Then he had
viewed unit as broken into another infinite scale„ and had
reduced to order all the operations of Arithmetio upon its
fraotions. It remained to condense the vast system into greater
simplieity and power, and also to display unit as the pivot for a
reoiprooal play of the Arabio scale, as he had done by zero. This
he aceomplished by his invention and calculation of Logarithms.
Moreover. in his brilliant performanoe of that promise to

Tyeho. he first applied—before either Newton or Leibnitz—
