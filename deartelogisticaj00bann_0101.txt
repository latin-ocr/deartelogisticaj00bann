is to be found. Yet the great lever with which Newton worked
was the Logaritlnns ; and the ‘Binoniial Theoreln, says Baron
Maseres, ‘ss is so very closely connected with the subject of
Logaritlnns„ as to be the foundation of the best methods of

computing them?²

In Napier’s Aritlnnetic‚ (p. 500 which Newton certainly
never saw, there is a figurate diagrmn, worthy of especial
notice, as being an unknown anticipation of the Aritlnnetical
Triangle of the celebrated Blaise Pascal3 presented, however,
in a far more beautiful form than that. of the French inathe-
matician. The properties of this triangle are so 'intimately
connected with the Binomial Theorein, that Bernoulli, on that
account, soinewhat rashly claiins for Pascal the inerit of the
invention. ‘⁴ Nous avons trouve,''’ he says„ “ ce merveilleux
theoreme aussi bien que M. Newtom d'une inaniere plus simple
que la sienne. Feu M. Pascal a ete le premier qui l’a
inventee.⁷’ Maseres, who republished Pascal’s matheinatical
works‚ says of theim—‘⁴ These works are so full of genius and
invention, that I thought I should do a service to the inathe-
maticians of Great Britain by republishing them in this collec-
tion. Some of them, and more especially his Aritlnnetical
Triangle⁷ have a considerable connexion with Logaritlnnsa

by affording a good demonstration of Sir Isaac Newton's
