Which hint Neper taking„ he desired him 31 his return to call
upon him again. Craig, after some weeks had passed7 did so·
amd Neper then shewed him a rude draught of what he called
Canon Mirabssis Logarithmorum. Which draught, with some
alterations, he printing in 1614, it came forthwith into the
hands of our author B1²iggs‚ and into those of Will. Oughtred,

Any one at al] conversam: with the history of science, and
the nature of the invention of Logarifflnns„ will at once per-

have„ it is here inaccurately and ignorantly told. Longomon-
tanus was the pupil and assistant of Tycho 31 Uraniburg„ and
3 most distinguished mathematician. He„ in common with
many others² was well acquainted with 3 principle of numerical
progression„ the extraordinary generalization of which by
Napier is that which constitutes the invention of Logarithms.
Archimedes had first observed and speculated upon such pro-
gressions, but without discovering the Logarithms. It could not
possibly be, that 3 111111 from Longomontanus had suggested
to Napier his great invention3 for if a ln‘nt of the kind could
have urged any human intellect thus rapidly upon the concep-

tion of the Logarithms themselves, that hint had arisen in the
