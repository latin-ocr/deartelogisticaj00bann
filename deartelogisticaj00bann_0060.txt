xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

in this little book of Ursin⁷s, these Logarithms had been
accurately investigated. Calling to my aidq therefore, J anus
Gringalletus Sabaudus, my familiar„ Ι ordered him to subtract
the thousandth part of the whole sine7—again, to subtract the
thousandth part of that residue5 and to repeat this operation
more than two thousand times, until there remained about the
tenth part of the whole sine3 but of the sine from whieh a
thousandth part had been subm-acted. I eomputed the loga-
rithm with the greatest care, beginning from the unit of that
division which Pitiseus most frequently uses, namely, the duo-
deeimal. The logarithm thus eoniputed, Ι arranged uniformly
with the remainders of all the subtraetions. In this manner.
I aseertained that these logarithms were as nearly perfect as
possible, although a few errors had crept in, either of the press„
or in that minute distribution of the greater logarithms about
the beginning of the quadrant. I mention all this to you by
the way, in order that you may understand how gratifying it
would be, to me at least (and Ι should think to others), if you
would put the world in possession of the methods by which you
prooeeded. Of these, I make no doubt, you have many, and
most ingenious, at your command intuitively. And so the
promise held out by you on the 57th page of your worl<‚⁷’ (to
put the world in possession of his methods of construeting the

Logarithms, should he understand that the invention was
