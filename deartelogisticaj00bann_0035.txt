little work, concerning the mechanism and use of the rods. I
was specially impelledq not merely by the fact. that they are so
approved of as to be already almost in common use* and even
carried to foreign countries; but because it also reached my

Τ1113 very friendly counsel from your Lordship ought to have
the greatest weight with me; and most assuredly, but for that,
this little treatise of the use of the rods (to which the other two
compendious methods are added, by way of appendix). xyould
never have seen the light. If„ therefore. any thanks be due from
the students of mathematics for these little books„ they all belong
to you as your just right„ my noble Lord: to you, indeed,
they must spontaneously fly, not only as patron„ but a second
