Napier commences what he ternis Geometrical Logistic
with an important principle,—his profound consideration and
command of which most probably paved 'the way to his great
invention. He views quantity and number under two different
aspects or conditions3 namely, either as separated into distinct
parts. capable of being* exactly expressed by absolute numbers.
or fractions of numbers, which he terms discrete quantity and
nuniber3 or, as consisting of an infinite continuity of parts.

Napier adds, ‘⁶ is the root of a number whose root cannot
be measured 3 that is, exactly and finitely expressed by any
number, integral or fi²actional.'⁷ He had already explained

that the numerical quantity, generally termed the Power of a
