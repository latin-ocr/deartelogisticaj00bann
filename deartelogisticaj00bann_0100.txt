lxxviii INTRODUCTION.

with which they are generated3 and calling these velocities of
the motions or increments Fluxions„ and the generated quanti-

ties Fluents2 I fell by degi-ees upon the method of Fluxions,

which I have made use of here in the qua(h‘ature of curves„ in
the years 1665 and 1666.” It is remarkable, that, instead of
merely referring to the aneients in this passage, Newton had
not rather said,—‘ And after this manner Napier, by drawing
a moveable point along a right line„ taught the genesis of
Logarithms ς and when I speak of quantities becoming greater
or less according to the greater or less velocity with which the
increase and decrease are generated„ and of determining quan-
tities from the velocities of the motions or increments with
which they are generateQ—aud when I call these velocities
of the motions or inerements Fluxions„—I avail myself of
Napier’s demonstratiom I adopt l1islanguage,—and even his
very expressions„ ‘⁶ fiuqu9 and ‘⁶ incrementi aut decrementi?”
Newton may have closely studied Napier’s published works„ or
he may never have seen them. The first idea is suggested by
the above remarkable coincidences of thought and expression ;
and also by the fact that Newton's Commentaries on Seriptural
prophecy is little else than a less elaborate repetition of Napier’s.
The other idea, however„ is after all the more likely, from this
circumstance, that„ throughout the voluininous published works

of Newton„ mathematical and theologica]q no notice of Napier
