the Logarithnis, Playfair's eulogy of him, quoted above, would
not have been merited3 for the arithmetie of powers and
exponents might have diselosed the Logarithms even to an
ordinary mathematieian. The more acciu-ate statement is„
that the invention of Logarithnis led the way to the algorithni
of powers. Napiem—writing„ be it remembered, some tinie in
the sixteenth century, before Vieta, Harriot‚ Girard, and
Oughtred‚ and when Algebra was not cultivated at all in this
eountry,-had no assistance from the algebraie refinement of
working known quantities by means of other symbols than the
significant digits, or of expressing powers by means of small
letters instead of numerals. He did not, for instance, consider
αααα as the quadruplicatum (to use his own term) of any
number α ; still less did he consider the sanie quantity in this
form7 (ὓς 116 had neither the literal notation of powers, nor the
numeral notation of indices 3 for although, in explaining their
genesis. he named the indices. one, two, three, &Q and also
noted and arranged them above the powers by the numerals 1,
2. 3, &Q yet he did not systematieally attach them to the root
for the expression of the power. To have done so would have
been to antieipate the notation of Deseartes, whose epoeh is
1637, twenty years after Napier's death. But, while he had
not these advantages to lead him to the Logarithms‚ the

arithmetie of exponents was so obviously to be dedueed from
