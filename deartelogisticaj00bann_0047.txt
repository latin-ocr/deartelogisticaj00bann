term Logarithms, under which denomination, however, they
were first published. He himself alludes to the long labour
bestowed upon his Canon, and to the interesting fact that his
operose calculations were entirely performed by himself. M.

prodigy of laborious patience. As we refiect upon the time
and toil it must have eost him to calculate all those numbers,
we shudder at the chauces there were of his being cut off ere
he had realized his idea‚ and of 115 having died with him. It
