to the Construction itself a eertain appendix, eoneerning the

Canon, in eonsequenee of the singular affec-tion that existed
between him and my father of illustrious memorffl—the method
of construction and explanation of its use being left to the
inventor himself. But nom sinee he has been called from this

life, the whole burden of the business rests upon the learned
