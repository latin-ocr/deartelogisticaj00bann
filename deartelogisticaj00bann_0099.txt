adopted by Sir Isaac Ncwton‚ in similar 1611115, 10 illustrate
his own discovery of Fluxions. The accidental circumstance,
or first idea, which may have led any great inventor into
the path of his distinction, can rarely be discovered. I have
endeavoured to illustrate Napier’s progress to the Loga-
ritlnns through his 11131116111311631 studies now published.
N ewton himself, in his treatise of the Quadrature of Curves,
announces thc lnethod that led him to his great discovery of
Fluxions. “ Ι 601151(161,” 116 says, ιι11131116111311631 quantities
in this place not as consisting of very small 113115, 11111 35
described by a continued motion. Lines are described, and
therefore generatech not by the opposition of 113115, but by the
continued motion of points 3 superficies by the motion of lines 3
solids by the motion of superficies3 angles by the 101311011 of
the sides; 1101110115 of time by a continual flux3 and so in
other quantities. These geneses really take place in the nature
of things, and are daily seen in the motion of bodies. And
after this manner the ancients, by (hawing moveable right
lines along innnoveable right lines, taught the genesis of rect-
angles. Therefore‚ considering that quantities which increase
in equal 1111165, 311(1 by increasing are generatedff become greater
or less according 10 1116 greater or less velocity with which they
increase and are generated, I sought a method of determining

quantities From the velocities of the motion or increments
