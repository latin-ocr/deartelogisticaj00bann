calculations. Biot tells us.. that he could only discover une

petite faute de ce genre. une tres petite faute.'' We may
assume, then, that Napier's great invention had first occurred
to him many years before its publication. Indeed the following

of the secret7 and preparing his publication of the Logarithms.

some time before the close of the sixteenth century.

It is a remarkable fact, not generally known, that Trono
Banu: obtained some hint of this boon to be conferred
upon science. twenty years before Napier’s other avocations.
added to the tedious labour of the calculations and his
own diffidence‚ permitted him to give his invention to the
world. Sir Archibald Napier of Merchistom the father of
the great Napier. was Justice-Depute in the reign of Mary
